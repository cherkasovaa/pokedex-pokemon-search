export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi! I'm Alina. <span>I’m glad you’re here</span>!

Welcome to my small pet-project - <span>Pokédex: Pokémon Search</span>! This web application was created in July 2025 as part of my studies in the [RS School React course](https://rs.school/courses/reactjs). The project was <span>built with enthusiasm and a love</span> for web design and modern technologies.

The core of the app is built with <span>React</span> and <span>TypeScript</span>. I used <span>Tailwind CSS</span> to create an elegant and responsive design. The entire development, testing, and build process was fast and efficient thanks to <span>Vite and Vitest</span>. Finally, everything is easily deployed online with <span>Vercel</span>.

If you’d like to see what else I’m working on, <span>feel free to check out</span> my [portfolio](https://cherkasovaa.vercel.app) or browse my other projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/cherkasovaa/).

I hope you enjoyed it! <span>Thank you for stopping by</span>!`;
